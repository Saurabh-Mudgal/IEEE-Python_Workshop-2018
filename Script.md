# Python Workshop 2018

## Introduction


Hello, I hope everyone was able to download and install python and your choice of text editor. If for some reason that is not the case, you can see our helpful friends in the blue t shirt. Please approach them or raise your hand, they’ll come and solve any issues you’re facing. So let’s get the learning started. I have to start off by introducing myself to you and then later on also have to intoduce you to python. So I thought why not do both of them together. I'll introduce myself through a pyhton code.
When you're learning a coding language it's like learning any spanish or french for the first time. You have to learn the grammer (syntax), the conventions (types and variables), the phrases (library/ classes/ functions) and above all practice. Python is just like that. If you look at the code, the output, displayed in English, is loud and clear but if you're new to software programming chances are that you will find the way the code is written a bit unfamiliar. But I promise you that if you can lend me your patience for the next hour this code will be a child's play for you.
