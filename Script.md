# Python Workshop 2018

## Introduction


Hello, I hope everyone was able to download and install python and your choice of text editor. If for some reason that is not the case, you can see our helpful friends in the blue t-shirt. Please approach them or raise your hand, they’ll come and solve any issues you’re facing. So let’s get the learning started. I have to start off by introducing myself to you and then later on also have to introduce you to python. So I thought why not do both of them together. I'll introduce myself through a python code.

So now that you have seen you're first code, I think we can define it. In easy words, a code is a set of instructions that tells the computer to do something.

I believe this is the first programming experience for most of you. When you're learning a coding language it's like learning any Spanish or French for the first time. You have to learn the grammar (syntax), the conventions (types and variables), the phrases (library/ classes/ functions) and above all you have to practice. If you look at the introductory code, the output is displayed in English and is readable and the sentence makes some sense. However, if you look at the input you will find there is a code written to which is really different from the output. And I promise you that if you can lend me your patience for the next hour working with such codes will be a child's play for you.

But why do we need to code? Why do we need python in the first place? This is because a language barrier exists between humans and the machinery or computers. Computers can't understand English or Spanish or any other human language. The only language they understand is the binary language. Unlike English, which uses combinations of 26 alphabets to build words, binary language is very hard to read because it represents words or data as a combination of only two digits, 1 and 0. You can learn more about this in your own time but for the purposes of this workshop, you just need to know that binary language is not easily interpreted by humans.

So how do we software engineers solve this problem. That is where software programming comes into play. 

>Software programming - compile-run cycle, etc

Python is a tool at the disposal of human beings to interact with the computers and machinery. It is a tool through which humans can use to tell the computers to do something. So, the language we understand is English, the language computers understand is binary and Python can be thought of as mediator language that can be easily comprehended by humans and can be effectively translated to binary language. If python is the mediator language, the Komodo Edit IDE that we are using can be thought of as the magical book containing the instructions written in python code which translates them to binary language for computers to understand. So python is actually a bridge for the language barrier that exists between humans and computer.

Now, you've had a thorough introduction to programming. Let's proceed to more interesting detials of the language.
