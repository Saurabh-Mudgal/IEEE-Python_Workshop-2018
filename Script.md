# Python Workshop 2018


## Introduction


Hello, I hope everyone was able to download and install python and your choice of text editor. If for some reason that is not the case, you can see our helpful friends in the blue t-shirt. Please approach them or raise your hand, they’ll come and solve any issues you’re facing. So let’s get the learning started. I have to start off by introducing myself to you and then later on also have to introduce you to python. So I thought why not do both of them together. I'll introduce myself through a python code.

I believe this is the first programming experience for most of you. If you look at the introductory code, the output is displayed in English and is readable and the sentence makes some sense. However, if you look at the input you will find there is a code written to which is really different from the output. And I promise you that if you can lend me your patience for the next hour working with such codes will be a child's play for you.

## Syntax

When you're learning a coding language it's like learning any Spanish or French for the first time. You have to learn the grammar (syntax), the conventions (types and variables), the phrases (library/ classes/ functions) and above all you have to practice. Similarly when coding, you have to practice correct syntax. The syntax of a programming language is the set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered to be correctly structured pieces of code.

## What is a code and why do we need it?

So now that you have seen you're first code, I think we can define it. In easy words, a code is a set of instructions that tells the computer to do something. It sends detailed and exact instructions to the computer which are needed to solve a specific problem. These instructions are written using a programming language like python.

But why do we need to code? Why do we need python in the first place? This is because a language barrier exists between humans and the machinery or computers. Computers can't understand English or Spanish or any other human language. The only language they understand is the binary language. Unlike English, which uses combinations of 26 alphabets to build words, binary language is very hard to read because it represents words or data as a combination of only two digits, 1 and 0. You can learn more about this in your own time but for the purposes of this workshop, you just need to know that binary language is not easily interpreted by humans.

## Code to Binary

Now you might say that hey but the code we just saw was also written in English. So how do the alphabets of the code get converted to binary language 1s and 0s. This job is carried out by your IDE, integrated development environment. The IDE I'm using right now and most of you might have seen in the installation instruction video is Komodo Edit 11. The process through which the code is translated to binary language is called compiling. The compiling ability of an IDE is part of why we type our code there and not just in a word document.

## Libraries

This is followed by the process of linking, in which the IDE links your code to libraries. In programming, a library is a collection of precompiled routines that a program can use. In python, to include a library in your code just type import followed by the library's name. However, you should be careful to write this before any other line of code. In the example below, the platform library is linked to the code. This allows the code to use platform.python_version() function. Also note, there is a line of text before the import platform statement. This is coloured grey because this is a comment. Anything a line that is followed by a #, is excluded from the code is only present as a comment. The hash is an indicator to the computer that this is a comment and should be overlooked.

## Python

### Points

So why  python. Python is a tool at the disposal of human beings to interact with the computers and machinery. It is a tool through which humans can use to tell the computers to do something. So, the language we understand is English, the language computers understand is binary and Python can be thought of as mediator language that can be easily comprehended by humans and can be effectively translated to binary language. 

What merit does it have over other programming languages. Python is known for its remarkable power yet a readable syntax. It is one of the easiest programming languages to learn but is also one of the most powerful languages, used heavily in machine learning and data science.

### History

Python was developed in the 1980s by Dutch programmer Guido van Russom. There's a core philosophy behind the Python language, which includes the following statements: Beautiful is better than ugly.

It's always a good idea to make your code elegant and readable. Explicit is better than implicit. Don't make your readers guess what your code does, make it obvious. Simple is better than complex. If you can make it simple, do. Readability counts. As a casual reader with a good understanding of the Python language, you should be able to understand the code with a minimal amount of effort.

Python 3 is very close to Guido's ideal vision for python. This workshop will teach python 3. Note that there is a considerable difference between python 3 and python 2. Python 3 is also isn't backward compatible; which means codes written in python 3 might not be compatible with python 2.

Also, its worth noting that python 3 is executed line-by line in a sequential fashion

Now, you've had a thorough introduction to programming. Let's proceed to some noteworthy detials of the language. 


## Python Applications

Python has potential applications in an array of fields:

### Surveying

Python is a widely popular platform for developing surveying softwares and data analysis. A basic principle behind these applications is the ease with which data can be collected. 

> example 5, taking input and then printing it

A more complex code strip can be added to these statements to also on-the-spot analyse data, present results or predictions and make suggestions. Such a complex code will require more attention than just an hour and can't be discussed today. However, for your referance, I'll make sure to send you some post-workshop resources which will contain such codes.

### Finance

Finance industry, for example, can save large chunks of time by using pre-written python codes to carry out calculations and tabulations. An over-simplified of the codes is presented below.

> example 4, operators can be used for financing and trade calculations and operation considering how quickly it processes information
> float value trade off precision for accuracy
> solution for money realated calculations

### Concluding Excercise

That is time for me. I hope I have equipped you with some basic knowledge of python that is of use for you. But before I go, you would remember I pointed out how powerful python can be with respect to surveys and data analysis. How about we put it to test.
