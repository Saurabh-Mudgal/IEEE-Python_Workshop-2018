# Python Workshop 2018

## Introduction


Hello, I hope everyone was able to download and install python and your choice of text editor. If for some reason that is not the case, you can see our helpful friends in the blue t shirt. Please approach them or raise your hand, they’ll come and solve any issues you’re facing. So let’s get the learning started. I have to start off by introducing myself to you and then later on also have to intoduce you to python. So I thought why not do both of them together. I'll introduce myself through a pyhton code.
