*__Disclaimer:__ This document is meant to serve as a reference for the attendees of IEEE Python Workshop 2018. It does not cover all concepts and implementations discussed in the workshop.*


## Hello!

Following is the output for the code:

> Welcome to IEEE Python Workshop 2018 edition. It's my pleasure to conduct today's workshop for you.

>My name is Saurabh Mudgal.

>I am 19.0 years old and am majoring in mechanical engineering.

If you wish to display the aforementioned output as text on the computer screen the following python code should be written and executed:

```python 3
age = 5+(8%3)-3+(3*10)/2

greetings = 'Welcome to IEEE Python Workshop 2018 edition. It's my pleasure to conduct today's workshop for you.'

name = 'Saurabh Mudgal'

major = 'mechanical engineering'


print(greetings)

print('My name is ' + name + '.')

print('I am ' + str(age) + ' years old and am majoring in ' + major + '.')
```

## Basic Syntax

__Statement:__ Each line of code in a Python program is called a statement. Python interprets statements and runs them one by one.

__Comments:__ The `#` symbol indicates a comment and anything after # is ignored by the computer. Comments provide information to improve code readability.

Built-in Functions: Python comes with many built-in functions like print() & input() to help you in writing your code.
